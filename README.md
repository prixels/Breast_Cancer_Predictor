<h1>Introduction</h1>
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a patient having breast cancer based on a set of diagnostic features. The model was trained on a dataset of breast cancer cases collected by the University of Wisconsin, and has been evaluated using a variety of metrics to ensure its performance.

<h1>Dependencies</h1>
The following software libraries are required to run the model:

* Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

<h1>Data</h1>
The dataset used to train and test the model is the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset, which can be obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)). The dataset contains 569 samples, each with 30 features and a binary label indicating the presence or absence of breast cancer.

The data has been pre-processed to normalize the features and remove any missing values.
