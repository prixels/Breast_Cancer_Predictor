Introduction
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a patient having breast cancer based on a set of diagnostic features. The model was trained on a dataset of breast cancer cases collected by the University of Wisconsin, and has been evaluated using a variety of metrics to ensure its performance.
